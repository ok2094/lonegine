###### lonegine (lonely engine) is a visual novel engine written in Java.
###### It's my first Java project so it's pretty bad and I have already abandoned it. The plan was to make a Visual Novel Engine that is entirely controlled by swappable databases that contain all of the visual novel contents in an unified system with which each visual novel is able to control the engine and be played.
